\section{Introduction}
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
In the last years the Internet has changed rapidly. Users not only retrieve information of simple websites anymore, rather they are sharing information, videos and pictures all over through networks.
With the "Web 2.0", user-generated content has become an important part of the Internet we know nowadays. Well-known platforms like, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter make it easy for regular people to distribute data and media.

With the changing role of mobile phones from simple communication devices to devices with a multiplicity of functionalities, user-generated content has even seen a faster growth in recent years. Due to more precise sensors, integrated high-resolution cameras and of course faster mobile network technologies, it has never been so simple to contribute content when ever and where ever you want. 
This fact leads to complete new opportunities for web services using data and user information, in order to create dynamic content.

Let us imagine an interesting, public event like a political speech, concert or any kind of sport event, which is not filmed and streamed professionally by TV channels. Fortunately it has become common of spectators nowadays to capture parts of ongoing events by their phone camera. The potentials are tremendous. Why not using these user-generated media to provide a real-time stream or list of videos of the ongoing event, which not present people could therefore follow anyhow. A high quality mash up of an event requires an complex selection of all potential videos available, in order to cover the whole event with the best quality provided and being aware of bandwidth constraints of the mobile network. 

In the following paper we want to deal with this kind of situations and introduce our implemented approach of an Automatic Mobile Video Director. Thereby we focus on the interaction between multi clients and one central server, our automatic video director, while addressing bandwidth and complexity problems, already mentioned above. Furthermore we do not focus on retrieving sensor information, which is done only in a rudimentary and simple way.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
%
%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.

% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% However, Computer Society journals sometimes do use bottom floats - bear
% this in mind when choosing appropriate optional arguments for the
% figure/table environments.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{System Overview}
BRAINSTORMING: goal of our application? Client-Server architecture? RESTful Web Service.

\subsection{Client application}
BRAINSTORMING: archtitecture? android sdk, camera, mediamanager, sensor, http client, service class, sqlite.

\subsection{Server application}
Server general description goes here.
Video storage, database connection, server framework description. RESTful Web Service

\subsection{Client-server interaction}
BRAINSTROMING: HTTP protocol, 

\subsubsection{Protocols}
Our Automatic Mobile Video Director server implementation provides 
a general interface to applications which wish to interact with it. 
It is implemented through HTTP requests to certain server locations result.

\begin{description}
	\item[GET /events]\hfill\\
		Lists all events (including videos) in~JSON.
		
	\item[GET /event/\textit{id}]\hfill\\
		Returns Event (including videos) in~JSON.
				
	\item[POST /event/new]\hfill\\
		Create new event from JSON.
		Expects request body to be a JSON string containing attribute~\textit{name}.
		
	\item[POST /event/\textit{id}]\hfill\\
		Upload JSON metadata about a video for Event with given \textit{id}.
		
	\item[PUT /video/\textit{video\_id}]\hfill\\
		Upload video~\textit{video\_id} from Event~\textit{id}.
		Expects request body to be a file stream containing a full video file.
		
	\item[GET /video/\textit{video\_id}]\hfill\\
		Retrieve video~\textit{video\_id} from Event~\textit{id}.
		
	\item[GET /selected]\hfill\\
		Retrieve a list of selected but not yet uploaded videos in JSON.		
		
\end{description}

\subsection{Metadata format}
JSON vs XML arguments here
As a final result we should state that metadata is transferred in JSON format.
% TODO Dummy metadata description.
\begin{description}
	\item[id]\hfill\\
		Client-side unique identification of the video.
		
	\item[filename]\hfill\\
		File name in client's local file system.
		
	\item[timestamp]\hfill\\
		Video creation time.
		%TODO Is it really so?
		
	\item[duration]\hfill\\
		Video duration in frames.
		%TODO This thing too.
		
	\item[width]\hfill\\
		Video frame width in pixels.

	\item[height]\hfill\\
		Video frame height in pixels.		
	
	\item[shaking]\hfill\\
		Amount of shaking detected by sensors.
	
	\item[status]\hfill\\
		Video status. Indicates video life cycle phase.
		% TODO It would be nice to decide on video lifecycle both client- and server-side.
		%	It would make a nice diagram to include in the report.
	
	\item[serverId]\hfill\\
		Server-side unique identification of the video. Needed for coordination of all clients.
